### filament types

#### PETG

Strength & Rigid
Temperature resistant
Durable & Tough
Easy to print
Low warping

PETG is one of the most commonly used filaments. It is an excellent choice for printing mechanically stressed parts. Compared to PLA, it is more heat resistant, more flexible and less brittle.

####  PLA

Brittle 
Easy to print
Hard and tough
Low warping

PLA is the most commonly used filament. It’s a very strong, easy to print and biodegradable material. The perfect choice for printing large objects thanks to its low thermal expansion (with little to no warping) and for printing tiny parts because of its low melting temperature

#### ASA

Can be smoothed
Tough
Recyclable
UV stable
High temperature resistance

ASA can be considered a true successor to ABS. Compared to ABS, it’s UV stable, it doesn’t suffer from shrinking so badly and the fumes produced are much less noticeable.
