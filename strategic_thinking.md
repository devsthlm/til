# Strategic Thinking

What got you here won't get you there.

Embrace strategic thinking.
It's not a one-time activity. Has to be continuous.

Strategic thinking
Re-evaluate new information and adapting accordingly.

1. Questioning assumptions. - Why do we do it that way? Interrogate habits and practices in a targeted way. Ask targeted questions.
1. Observing - Observe the big picture.
1. Reflecting - We are too preoccupied to have time for reflection. Make space/time in order to let creativity happen. 

## Strategy: Not just for corporations

>You could be the best in the world but if your boss doesn't notice then it's almost like it didn't happen.

Align your strategy with what makes a difference to the organization.

Strategic thinking is not just for work but for your career. "Where to I want to be in 5 years?"

## The sequence of strategy

The path from long-term down to short term. Metaphore: Road into the horizon.
Vision - Strategy

> Be clear and proactive in what you're *going to do*, and what you're *not going to do*.

Vision > Strategy > Goals

Tactics. Don't expect things to happend just because you want to.

Tactics - Activities that make your *goals*, *strategy* and *vision* come to life

## Make time to be strategic

Turn off all noise and sit with your thoughts. Be deliberate.

Where do you want to be going? Are you going in the right directions.

Block your calendars. One hour per week. Treat it like a firm commitment. Protect the time.

Enlist a friend to hold you accountable.

## Consider the future and learn from the past

Recognize macro trends in society

Monitor trends
* read voraciously
* identify informed people

scenario building
* mapping out multiple possible ways for the future

Understand the past
* what & _why_ (don't stop looking at the first reason you found)
    * simple answers aren't always the answer
    * is there more?

## How to create an informed strategy

_Informed_ strategy.

Three ways to become smarter and more nuanced in your strategic thinking

1. Good strategy *doesn't have to be innovative*. 
    * It is about making choices. 
    * Look to past success.
1. Consider the *future trends* in your industry.
    * 
1. Solicit input from *diverse sources*.
    * Don't just stay with your own thoughts or usual inputs. Find people in your "orbit".

## Practicality: Get real about your strategy

Map your assets and allies.
What skills, knowledge assets do you have that can help you?

Find key allies

Identify your constraints

Create specific steps. Goal and steps to take to get there.


## Strategic thinking with your team

Don't unveil your strategy at the "strategy meeting". The real input is before that. You don't want to share your strategy the first time at a meeting at the risk of having it shot down. 

* Have pre-meetings. Bring others along in the process.
* Identify objections. You can come up with 90% of the objections before and have answers to them.
* Prepare to meet objectors. "Turn them down from nuclear to dissatisfied"
* Create systems for accountability. 
    * Micro: Send emails after a meeting on who said what.
    * Macro: reiterating frequently what your timeline is and what markers are on that timeline, the path to that timeline and assuring there is no slippage.

Defenders dilemma: As a defender you have to cover everything but as an attacker you only need to find one weakness.
