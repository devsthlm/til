## Tactful bragging

"Self promotion"

Tactful bragging is about "making a connection with the person you are interacting with, while sharing something about yourself that will help you stand out"

Bragging in todays culture is not a X, it's a necessity. You cannot afford not to do it.

Book: "Brag! - The art of tooting your own horn without blowing it" - Peggy Klaus

A successful brag has three components.
1. Focus on results vs title
    * "I lead a sales team that landed 5 accounts last year" vs "I'm a project manager"
    * "I coach professionals to be exceptional speakers" vs. "I teach a business information course"
1. Focus on process vs. job description
    * "I manage by promoting autonomy and creativity for my team to reach their highest potential" vs. "I oversee staff in five different regions"
    * "I focus on experiential learning since teching is a coachable skill" vs. "I have X amounts of students, ..."
1. Loop back to your audience
    * "I heard you mention earlier that you work with a team, do you find that autonomy is a motivator?"
    * "Do you think our speaker today received some coacing at some point"

Self promotion is something you cannot afford not to do.
"Take the Bragg test"?
